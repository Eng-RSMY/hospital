    <h1>We provide quality health care to patients.</h1>
 	<span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: serif; font-style: normal;">
 	            Delivering the right care at the right time in the right setting is the core
    mission of hospitals across the country. Birla is committed to helping members improve 
    the quality of care they deliver every day. We do so by providing information and assistance
    on how to improve care and by working with federal lawmakers, regulators and research 
    agencies to create a policy environment on which quality and safety can thrive. 

                 Please come back to this site often to see the latest news from the field and 
    updates on Birla policy and advocacy. Go to our internet sites to check out the full range of
    resources available from the many different Birla initiatives addressing improvement in quality
    and patient safety.
