    <h1>Cardiology Department</h1>
 	<p>
Cardiology is a branch of medicine dealing with disorders of the heart be it human or animal. The field includes medical diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart defects, coronary artery disease, heart failure, valvular heart disease and electrophysiology. Physicians who specialize in this field of medicine are called cardiologists, a specialty of internal medicine. Pediatric cardiologists are pediatricians who specialize in cardiology. Physicians who specialize in cardiac surgery are called cardiothoracic surgeons or cardiac surgeons, a specialty of general surgery.
 	</p>
 	<p>
All cardiologists study the disorders of the heart, but the study of adult and child heart disorders are through different training pathways. Therefore, an adult cardiologists (often unqualified and called just "cardiologist") is inadequately trained to take care of children, and pediatric cardiologists are inadequately trained to take care of adults.
    </p>
    <p>
    Disorders of the coronary circulation
Coronary arteries labeled in red text and other landmarks in blue text.
</p>
<p>
Contrary to a basic understanding of the cardiovascular system, the heart cannot itself receive enough oxygen and nutrients from the blood it pumps and it must be supplied with blood as if it were any other organ in the body. Unlike the systemic organs the heart receives perfusion in the phase of diastole rather than systole. This circulation of blood is called the coronary circulation. The coronary circulation consists of coronary arteries and coronary veins.
</p>
<p>
Disorders of the coronary circulation can have devastating effects to the heart since damage to the heart can reduce coronary circulation which causes further damage. A few examples are presented, as follows:
</p>
<p>
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) 
    Acute coronary syndrome is a broad term encompassing many acute myocardial infarction symptoms.
</p>
<p>
Angina pectoris
    Angina pectoris literally means "chest pain" that refers to pain caused by ischemia of the heart.
</p>
<p>
Atherosclerosis
    Atherosclerosis is the condition in which an artery wall thickens as the result of a build-up of fatty materials (e.g., cholesterol). Atherosclerosis of a coronary artery leads to coronary heart disease.
</p>
<p>
Coronary heart disease
    Coronary heart disease is a general term for any reduction in coronary circulation. One such condition is atherosclerosis.
</p>
<p>
Myocardial infarction (a.k.a. heart attack) 
    A myocardial infarction is the death of a part of the heart which is typically caused by a blockage of the coronary circulation or coronary heart disease.
</p>
<p>
Restenosis
    Recurrence of stenosis which would refer to a narrowing of a coronary artery in the context of the coronary circulation.
</p>
<p>
Cardiac arrest
A rhythm strip showing a couple beats of normal sinus rhythm followed by an atrial beat and asystole ("flatline").

Cardiac arrest refers to the cessation of normal systemic circulation due to failure in proper contraction of the heart. There are several conditions that can cause cardiac arrest.
</p>
<p>
Asystole ("flatline") 
    Asystole refers to the absence of electrical activity of the heart and is sometimes referred to as a "flatline" because the electrocardiogram shows a solid line due to the absence of electrical activity.
</p>
<p>
Pulseless electrical activity (PEA) 
    Pulseless electrical activity is when the electrocardiogram shows a rhythm that should produce a pulse but it does not. PEA is commonly caused by the 6 H's and 6 T's (see PEA article).
</p>
<p>
Pulseless ventricular tachycardia
    Pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) Is one classification of VT such that no pulse is felt because of an ineffective cardiac output which causes cardiac arrest.
</p>
<p>
Sudden cardiac death
    Sudden cardiac death is a concept of natural death rather than a specific medical condition. There are several causes of sudden cardiac death and it is distinct from cardiac arrest.
</p>
<p>
Ventricular fibrillation
    Ventricular fibrillation is fibrillation of the ventricles of the heart. Rhythmic contraction is necessary for efficient movement of blood, and fibrillation disrupts this rhythm sufficiently to cause cardiac arrest.
</p>
<p>
Treatment of cardiac arrest includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation depending on the exact cause of cardiac arrest.
Disorders of the myocardium (muscle of the heart)
</p>
<p>
A man with congestive heart failure and marked jugular venous distension. External jugular vein marked by an arrow.

            Cardiomyopathy caused by dilation of the heart.
</p>
  <p>          Alcoholic cardiomyopathy
                A type of dilated cardiomyopathy caused by chronic abuse of alcohol.</p>
       <p>     Tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
                A type of dilated cardiomyopathy caused by chronic tachycardia.</p>
          <p>  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (Transient apical ballooning, stress-induced cardiomyopathy) 
                A type of dilated cardiomyopathy caused by a sudden temporary weakening of the myocardium.
</p>
      <p>  Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) 
            Cardiomyopathy caused by a genetic mutation of the desmosomes that connect myocytes.
        Restrictive cardiomyopathy
            Cardiomyopathy caused by excessive rigidity of the heart.
</p>
<p>Heart failure
    Failure of the heart to produce sufficient blood flow to meet metabolic demands of the body.
